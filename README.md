# tr1-controller-demo
This repository contains code for running a simple controller demo on the Slate TR1. The demo allows the user to control all actuators on the robot using the Xbox controller included with the TR1.

The default, starting mode is navigation. In this mode, you may use the joysticks to drive the base. The left joystick controls translation along the ground, and the right joystick controls rotation.

To change to manipulation mode, press 'B' on the controller.
